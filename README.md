# mqtt-controller (WIP: Code coming soon.)
A D1 Mini carrier board for controlling MQTT devices, with 5 buttons and space for a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED display. 

## Components:
1x Wemos D1 mini developement board (or offbrand version)
1x 128x64 i2c SSD1306 OLED display
5x 6mm SMD-mounted tactile switches
2x 2 by 10 header socket (for mounting microcontroller)
1x 4-pin single row header socket (for mounting display)

(Note: header pins are optional, as the microcontroller/display can be soldered directly onto the board if that is more convenient)
